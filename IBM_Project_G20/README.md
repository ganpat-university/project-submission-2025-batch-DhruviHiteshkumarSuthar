# 😊 Face Emotion Recognition Using Deep Learning
A real-time face emotion recognition system that detects human emotions from live video using Deep Learning, OpenCV, and AWS Cloud Deployment.

## This project is currently in progress and is expected to be completed by the end of April 2025.
## 🚀 Features
1. 🎥 Real-Time Emotion Detection: Captures and analyzes facial expressions through a webcam.
1. 🧠 Accurate Emotion Classification: Utilizes a CNN+RNN hybrid model for improved accuracy.
1. 😃 Emotion Categories: Supports detection of seven emotions:
    - Happy
    - Sad
    - Angry
    - Neutral
    - Fearful
    - Disgusted
    - Surprised
1. ☁️ Cloud Deployment: Deployed on AWS EC2 using Docker containers.
1. 📦 Efficient Model Management: Integrated with CI/CD pipeline for automated model updates.
1. 📊 Logging & Monitoring: Logs stored in AWS CloudWatch for performance analysis and error tracking.
1. 🔎 Optimized Performance: Pruned model for better performance and reduced latency.
